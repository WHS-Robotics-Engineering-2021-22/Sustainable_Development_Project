# Project Overview

When I came home from boarding school recently I noticed an ironing vendor who pressed people's clothes for a living â€“ and his main appliance was an old-fashioned iron box, which he filled with hot charcoal that emitted a cloud of smoke.

There were six of these vendors in my neighborhood, all using charcoal and emitting lots of smoke.  It made me think about the amount of charcoal burnt every day and the damage it does to the environment.

I worked for about a month on my idea and from my research on solar power, I was able to come up with a solution.  This solution is the solar powered ironing cart.

The biggest challeng of this project has been to figure out how much electricity is needed to power the iron.  Fortunately the solar cell that is required to charge the batteries in the cart is also large enough to serve as a shade for the iron vendor.  The cart is a one time expense so, while the vendor will need to pay more up front, it will save them on the expense of buying charcoal.

# Next Steps

My next step will be to build a prototype next sememster in my Robotics Engineering class and hopefully be able to test the cart out in my neighborhood.  I am going to use my brother's old bike, an iron we already have at home and some scrap lumber that my parents have in the garage to save money.  My big expense will be the solar panel, charge controller, inverter and a battery.
